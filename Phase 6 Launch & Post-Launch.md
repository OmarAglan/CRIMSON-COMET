### **Module 6.1: The Final Countdown (Week 39 - Pre-Launch)**

**Sub-Goal:** To finalize all public-facing materials and prepare for the moment of release. This is the marketing and logistics push.

*   **Step 1: Storefront Finalization**
    *   **Task:** Complete and submit your game's store page on your chosen platform(s) (e.g., Steam, itch.io). This is your "digital box art" and is incredibly important.
    *   **Checklist:**
        *   **Compelling Trailer:** The final, polished gameplay trailer is uploaded.
        *   **High-Quality Screenshots:** A curated set of 10-15 screenshots showcasing the best moments (combat, environments, the Comet).
        *   **Game Description:** A well-written, concise description of the game's features and story hook.
        *   **System Requirements:** The final minimum and recommended hardware specs, determined during the optimization phase.
        *   **Pricing and Release Date:** The final price is set and the launch date is locked in.

*   **Step 2: Community & Press Preparation**
    *   **Task:** Prime your audience for launch day.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Announce the official release date on all your channels (Social Media, Discord, etc.).
        *   Prepare a press kit with the trailer, screenshots, and game description.
        *   Send out game keys to a small, curated list of press or content creators (YouTubers/Streamers) who cover your genre. Be prepared that many may not play it, but it's worth the effort.

*   **Step 3: Prepare the Day 1 Patch**
    *   **Task:** While waiting for launch, continue to work on any remaining low-priority, non-risky bug fixes (e.g., Trivial bugs from your tracker).
    *   **Benefit:** Having a "Day 1 Patch" ready to deploy shows that you are actively supporting the game from the very first moment. This builds immediate goodwill with early adopters who might encounter an unforeseen issue.

*   **End of Module 6.1 Checkpoint:** The store page is live and "Coming Soon." The community is aware of the release date. You have a build ready to go live and another one ready for a Day 1 patch if needed.

### **Module 6.2: Launch Day (Week 40)**

**Sub-Goal:** To successfully deploy the game and transition into a monitoring and communication role.

*   **Step 1: Press the Big Red Button**
    *   **Task:** On your chosen release date and time, follow the procedures on your distribution platform to make the game live and available for purchase.

*   **Step 2: Announce and Engage**
    *   **Task:** Announce that the game is now available on all your channels. Post the launch trailer.
    *   **Crucial:** Be present. Thank people for their support. Answer questions. Acknowledge bug reports politely and professionally. Your visibility on launch day is key.

*   **Step 3: Monitor All Channels**
    *   **Task:** Your primary job now is to listen. Keep a close watch on:
        *   **Steam Forums / Community Hub:** This will be a primary source for bug reports and feedback.
        *   **Discord / Social Media:** Watch for player comments and technical issues.
        *   **Sales Data:** Monitor sales, not for obsession, but to understand initial momentum.
        *   **Player Reviews:** Read reviews to understand first impressions, but do not get into arguments. Use them as a source of feedback.

*   **End of Module 6.2 Checkpoint:** The game is live! You've survived the launch. You have a preliminary list of immediate player-found issues and a general sense of the initial reception.

### **Module 6.3: Post-Launch Support (Weeks 41-42)**

**Sub-Goal:** To address critical issues found by the public and demonstrate responsive support for the game.

*   **Step 1: Triage and Hotfix**
    *   **Task:** Using the same triage method from the Beta phase, immediately categorize all incoming bug reports.
    *   **Priority:** Your absolute top priority is fixing any game-breaking crashes or progression blockers that were missed.
    *   **Workflow:** Work quickly to fix the most critical issues and deploy your first post-launch patch (this might be the "Day 1 Patch" you already prepared, or a new "Week 1 Patch").

*   **Step 2: Communication is Key**
    *   **Task:** Write clear patch notes. When you release an update, tell the players exactly what you fixed.
    *   **Transparency:** Acknowledge known issues that you haven't fixed yet. A simple "We are aware of an issue where X happens and are working on a fix" goes a long way in managing player expectations.

*   **Step 3: Collate Feedback for the Future**
    *   **Task:** Beyond bugs, listen to what players are saying about the game itself. Do they love the Bazooka but find the Gatling Gun useless? Is there a universal desire for a specific feature (like a New Game+ mode)?
    *   **Action:** Collect this qualitative feedback in a separate document. This will be invaluable for planning future updates.

*   **End of Module 6.3 Checkpoint:** The game is now significantly more stable than it was at launch. At least one or two patches have been successfully deployed. The community sees that the game is being actively supported.

---

### **Module 6.4: The Road Ahead (Ongoing)**

**Sub-Goal:** To transition from reactive bug-fixing to a sustainable, long-term plan for the game and yourself.

*   **Step 1: Evaluate and Plan**
    *   **Task:** After the initial launch storm has calmed, take stock. Review the game's reception and sales. Review the feedback you've collected.
    *   **Decision Time:** Decide what the future of CRIMSON COMET is. The options are:
        *   **Project Complete:** The game is considered finished. You will only release patches for major, game-breaking bugs.
        *   **Quality of Life Update:** Plan a larger future patch that addresses common player feedback (e.g., adding a New Game+ mode, balancing weapons).
        *   **Content DLC:** If the game is a success, plan a larger, potentially paid expansion with new missions or machines.

*   **Step 2: Communicate the Roadmap**
    *   **Task:** Whatever you decide, share a simple version of that plan with your community. This manages expectations and keeps your audience engaged.

*   **Step 3: Celebrate and Rest**
    *   **Task:** You have successfully navigated the entire lifecycle of game development, from a simple idea to a publicly released product. This is a monumental achievement. Take a well-deserved break to avoid burnout before starting your next project or update.

*   **End of Phase 6 - Final Review (Live Product):** **CRIMSON COMET** is no longer just a project; it is a live product with a community. You have successfully launched the game, supported its release, and have a clear vision for its future. The development roadmap is complete.
